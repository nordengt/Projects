# 02. Digit Recognition

Digit recognition is a classic problem in machine learning where the goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify and **Classify** handwritten digits. This type of project is often considered a fundamental task in computer vision and is frequently used as a starting point for understanding image classification problems. The application of digit recognition spans various domains, such as postal automation, bank check processing, and more recently, in the development of optical character recognition (OCR) systems for digitizing handwritten notes.

The main problem in digit recognition is to train a machine learning model to correctly classify images of handwritten digits into their respective numerical categories (0-9). The complexity lies in the variability of writing styles among individuals, different scales, rotations, and deformations of the digits. The model needs to be robust enough to handle these variations and generalize well to unseen data.

For a digit recognition project, a commonly used dataset is the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). Each image is labeled with the corresponding digit. The dataset is well-established, widely used, and serves as a benchmark for testing the performance of machine learning models in digit recognition. The MNIST dataset can be accessed through various machine learning libraries, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, or from online repositories.
