# 01. Predicting Iris Flower Species

The Iris Flower Species **Classification** project involves building a machine learning model to identify and classify different species of Iris flowers based on certain features. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for introductory exercises. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald A. Fisher in 1936.

The problem is a multiclass classification task. Given measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, the goal is to classify an Iris flower into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset for this project. It consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, each from one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). The four features (attributes) measured for each sample are sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The Iris dataset can be found in various machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
