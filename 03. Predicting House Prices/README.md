# 02. House Price Prediction Project

Real estate market is a vast and complex industry that involves buying, selling, renting or managing properties. One of the most important aspects in this field is determining the fair price of a property, which can be influenced by various factors such as location, size, number of rooms, age, and condition of the property among others. In order to help real estate professionals and individuals involved in buying or selling properties, a machine learning model for **Predicting** house prices based on relevant features is developed. This model will enable users to estimate the value of a property more accurately, facilitating decision making processes related to purchasing, selling or investing in real estate.

Given a dataset containing historical information about residential properties along with their corresponding sale prices, the goal is to build an accurate regression model capable of predicting the sales price of new properties based on their attributes (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.). The main challenge lies in identifying the most significant features affecting housing prices while accounting for potential multicollinearity issues between them. Additionally, outlier detection techniques might need to be applied to handle unusually high or low priced houses that could negatively impact the performance of the model.
